# Overview

I want to show my skills as a game developer and that I know the foundations to develop a first person shoot game. I want to show I have strong software development in C#.

This game is a first person shooter that simulates an apocalysis kombie time where a person need to kill zombies to survive. While player kill zombies appear more zombies and he need to kill more to earn more points. The game finished when the zombies kill the player.
